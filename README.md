Here, I have designed tables that hold  data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered the following questions about the data:

1- Employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2- First name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3- Manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

4- First name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

5- Each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

6- Each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7- The frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
